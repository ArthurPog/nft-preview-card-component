My *second* project using HTML and CSS only.

One of the biggest problems that I had was centering the SVGs vertically with the text that was next to them. Still don't know how it's done. I checked many tutorials and read documentations on W3C and, quite frankly, my head hurts. I'm sure Ill come back to this.
